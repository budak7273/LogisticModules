## Bugfixes

- Fix PowerSuit Modules being an optional dependency instead of a required one. This would hard crash you on launch if for some reason you didn't have PowerSuit Modules since it was needed for crafting componets.
  - It was originally planned to be an optional dependency (and the recipes would change depending on the presence of the mod) but we never got around to that. There aren't any other suit mods right now anyways. You should write one!
- Added WIP text overlay to the Building Filters button, to further clarify the feature is WIP
- Fix broken icon in the Building Filters GUI
