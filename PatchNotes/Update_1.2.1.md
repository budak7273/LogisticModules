This update brought to you by Robb#6731

## Known Bugs

- The hub's built-in storage container can't be seen by logistic modules
- The Subscriber module does not intelligently select the largest stack to pull from to supply its demands, so it could pull multiple smaller batches.

## Notice

**The balance of this mod is still being figured out. Power costs, recipes, and unlock order are all highly likely to change.**

Please leave suggestions and report issues either on the [Nog's Mods Discord](http://discord.gg/zqp6U7Y7Nu) or [as a Github issue](https://github.com/budak7273/ArmorModules/issues/new/choose).
